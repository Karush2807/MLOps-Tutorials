# end to end open-source mlops platform (really efficient and cool)

# experiment tracking, observibality, serving and complete lifecycle of DL

# it is opensourcE: can be integrated with any ml platform

# comprehensive: can be managed: ml and genai end to end workflows dev to production

# unified: unified platoform for both traditional ml and GENAI applications

# why, who and usecases of mlFlow?

1. data govt officer (involved in each steps)
2. data engineer (etl pipelines)
3. data scientist (feature engineering, model traing, model validation )
4. ml engineer (validation, deployment and monitoring)
5. business stakeholder

data prep[data engineer (for etl pipelines[aggregating data from api, databases or any other xyz source])] -> eda[data scientist, takes over from here] -> feature engineering -> model training -> model validation[yhn se ml engineer aajate hai, most imp role!!] -> deployment(aws/szure/gcp) -> monitoring

## data scientist leverage mlFLOW for: 
1. will probably be doing, experiment tracking and hypothesis testing (considering version control and other things)
2. code structuring 
3. model packaging and dependencies management 
4. evaluting hyper parameters tuning
(helps us to track, tunining in methods lik egrid searchCV etc. )
5. multiple model jo ham bnayenge for testing purposes we can compare the results of each model

## MLOps professionl and Ml Enginner
1. manage krte hai life cycles trained models ki
(pre and post development)
2. deploy model securely to the production environment
3. manage development dependencies

## Prompt + Engineering Users
1. evaluate with large language models too
2. (create custom prompts and experiment with them)
3. then in sab ke baad we can decide on some best model


## experiment tracking 
parameters and metrics ko track kr payenge

## model selection and deployment
mlops  profesisonals best model select karke use deploy krte hai :)

## model performance monitoring

## colllabiritive model

for eg: agr hm model train krrhe hai: to hm accuracy, training test result ko track krskte hai
